Just wanted to let you know I will still accept homework if you haven't turned
it in yet.  And if you want to update what you have, just send it to me again.
For your own sake (so you can enjoy the break!) let's say the really real
deadline is the end of tomorrow (Friday, the 26th).  Also, if you missed
office hours today, I gave some advice on a few problems.  You can find a pdf
of the notes here (file: ../lecture-pdfs/OH-March-25.pdf).  Stream is also on
twitch, but I don't think it will be very helpful (there's no audio).

Take care and have a good break :D
