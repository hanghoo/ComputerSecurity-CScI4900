You can submit scans of written work if you would prefer.  If you have a bit
of extra time, you could try to learn LaTeX.  I can give you the typesetting
source file for the homework pdf if you want!

<#1>: Does anyone know when this is due?

(wes): Let's say Friday March 12th.

Please confirm the new due date!

(wes): How about March 21st?  Let me know if you need more time.

<#1>: Sounds good, how do we submit; email or just upload into our repo and add you as a collaborator?

(wes): I'm fine with either, but maybe email is easiest?  Hope it is going
well!

<#1>: Cool. Getting there...work in progress!
